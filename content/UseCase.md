## New Hospitals Programme (NHP) - NHS ##

The demand and capacity model was originally developed to support the New Hospitals Programme (NHP) in the NHS. The model is being used by the NHP Schemes and their local health systems to estimate the furture healthcare activity which their hospital infrstructure weill need to accomodate. 

In this use case, the model being run at a Trust of Site level, with the model inputs being the Trust's current and future population, and the model outputs being the future healthcare activity at that Trust or Site.

Each Scheme assembles a core team to engage in the modelling process. Members of the core team receive training on how to use the model, and are supported by [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/).

A Scheme's core team engage with their local system partners to inform the setting of model parammeters such as activity mitigation.
