## Probabilistic Forecasting ##

The model accounts for the inherent uncertainty of forecasting future healthcare demand.

Many of the model input parameters allow the user to provide their forecasts in the form of ranges (80% prediction intervals) rather than point estimates. This enables users to quantify their uncertainty behind their input assumptions- the wider the range, the greater the uncertainty. 

When the model is run, it performs hundreds of simulations based on these input ranges, generating a distribution of possible future healthcare demand scenarios. As such, the model outputs enable the user to explore the variation in the projected demand and plan accordingly.

For a technical overview of the probabilistic forecasting approach used in the model, please refer to the [Overview of Methodology](connect.strategyunitwm.nhs/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/overview_of_methodology.html).
