Everything we've built is openly available and fully documented. The model represents one of the largest open-source releases of NHS analytical code to date, with its [codebase](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhs-models), [documentation](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/), and [quality assurance](https://github.com/orgs/The-Strategy-Unit/projects/6/views/2) fully available. There are no hidden assumptions or black boxes. Everything about our model can be examined and verified.

This commitment to openness reflects the NHP's core values and aligns with national policies such as [Data Saves Lives policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-soclial-care-with-data#supporting-local-and-national-decision-makers-with-date) and the [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis), which advocate for transparency to drive innovation, reduce duplication, and maximise public value. 

Beyond code sharing, the model sets a new precedent for transparency in NHS analytics and is already reducing duplication and improving learning across systems. The model's open-source nature allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, ensuring it remains relevant and effective in meeting the evolving needs of the NHS.
